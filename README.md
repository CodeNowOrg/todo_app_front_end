# CodeNow Sample Todo Application - Front End
Welcome to the codebase for the front-end mock-up of CodeNowâ€™s Sample Todo Application. 

You will use this front-end code to introduce students to HTML, CSS, and jQuery during weekend one of the workshop.

In this README, you will find a series of guides breaking down the steps to building the front-end of the Todo List application. These guides serve as a resource to help you prepare and as an outline to follow during the workshop itself.
